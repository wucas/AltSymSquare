# The GAP package AltSymSquare

This package provides functionality to compute efficient isomorphisms between
the natural representation of a classical group and its absolutely irreducible
representation on the alternating or symmetric square. The algorithms in this
package are the result of joint work by Anna Sucker, Csaba Schneider and Lucas
Wollenhaupt.
